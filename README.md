# ListerWeb
Lister ToDo app with Hibernate shoehorned in, and then all that crammed onto a Tomcat server

Using Maven and Hibernate, built on MySQL, with Tomcat 8.5

yes, i'm using old versions and maybe that's why I'm having such a hard time figuring out how to configure everything but mostly I think it's from a complete lack of useful tutorials that get updated and actually explain why you do things, not just "include this tag here, and write this line, and type this, and now it says hello world when you click on the button," instead of actually telling me why this tag looks like this and then all the tags I could possibly use and what each of them are for and I'm probably just upset 'cause this is a school project due in 3 days and the only resources we were given were YouTube videos from 5+ years ago.

Schema is in resources folder
Databse needs:
user - TestUser
pass - test
